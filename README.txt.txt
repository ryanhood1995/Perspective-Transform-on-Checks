This project was part of my Computer Vision course at UT Dallas.  The project was to be given a folder of images of cashier's 
checks.  The images would be taken at different angles and under different circumstances (for example, being held by someone).
The job was to perform a persepctive transformation so that it looks like the image was taken level with the check and the camera 
pointed directly at the check.  An examples folder was provided.


The driving python file is called driver.py.  If you run that and provide the folder path as input, the program will 
go through each image and show the original image and the final image.  Nothing is written.
